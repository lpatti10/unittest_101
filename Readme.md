Testing Testing Testing!!

Test the following underscore.js methods, and then implement your own versions of the methods. 

Your unit tests should cover everything: bad arguments, no arguments, values, types and errors.

Make sure to read through the Chai documentation - http://chaijs.com/api/

_.pluck
_.last
_.first
_.random

Also, set up a simple constructor like we did in class and run some tests on that in a different describe block.

The point is to get you use to writing tests and beginning to see the value of it.

This does not need to be deployed but should be on Github and all of the tests should pass.
